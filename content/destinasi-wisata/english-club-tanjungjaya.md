  We have offline class every Thursday at Cikadu, Tanjungjaya Village, Pandeglang, Banten. We teaches local citizens here because we want them to be able to communicate better with foreigners, as our village is one of special economic regions andany foreigners visit our village. We have been doing this activity since last month and the numbers of the kids who come to learn grow bigger day by day. Now their parents also come and join our class, which means it is a good sign. In the future we highly hope that all Tanjungjaya citizens, especially who live in Cikadu can have good understanding in English. Hopefully it will brighten their future.

  For you guys who want to visit us some time, please do come but remember to obey the Covid-19 protocols.
